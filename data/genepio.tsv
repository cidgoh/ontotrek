FOODON:03510124	FOODON:03510023				health-related claim or use	Health claim means any claim made on the label or in labeling of a food, including a dietary supplement, that expressly or by implication, including "third party" references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as "heart"), symbols (e.g., a heart symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition. See also 21 CFR 101.14  [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.14].  A claim is a health claim if in the naming of the substance or category of substances, there is a description or indication of a functionality or an implied effect on health; examples: "contains antioxidants" (the function is an antioxidant effect); "containsprobiotics/prebiotics" (the reference to probiotic/prebiotic implies a health benefit). Equally, claims which refer to an indication of a functionality in the description of a nutrient or a substance (for instance as an adjective to the substance) should also beclassified as a health claim; examples: "with prebiotic fibres" or "contains prebiotic fibres".  In Europe, a health claim is any statement about a relationship between food and health [http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/health_claims_en.htm], and only authorized health claims are legal [see http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/community_register/health_claims_en.htm].

FOODON:03510128	FOODON:03510023				organic food claim or use	USA: The 1990 Farm Act specifies that a food labeled 'organic' must meet four requirements:  1) the food must be raised by specified methods to replenish and maintain the fertility of the soil; 2) the food must be certified as having been produced with a nationally approved list of materials and practices; 3) to be eligible for certification at least three years must have elapsed between the first organic harvest and first use of nationally approved materials on land and crops;and 4) organic foods must meet all local, state and federal regulations governing the quality and safety of the food supply.

GAZ:00002459	GAZ:00000448			NCIT:C25464	United States of America	A federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district. The country is situated mostly in central North America, where its forty-eight contiguous states and Washington, DC, the capital district, lie between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The State of Alaska is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and Russia to the west across the Bering Strait, and the State of Hawaii is in the mid-Pacific. The United States also possesses several territories, or insular areas, that are scattered around the Caribbean and Pacific. The states are divided into smaller administrative regions, called counties in most states, exceptions being Alaska (parts of the state are organized into subdivisions called boroughs; the rest of the state's territory that is not included in any borough is divided into "census areas"), and Louisiana (which is divided into county-equivalents that are called parishes). There are also independent cities which are within particular states but not part of any particular county or consolidated city-counties. Another type of organization is where the city and county are unified and function as an independent city. There are thirty-nine independent cities in Virginia and other independent cities or city-counties are San Francisco, California, Baltimore, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Denver, Colorado and Carson City, Nevada. Counties can include a number of cities, towns, villages, or hamlets, or sometimes just a part of a city. Counties have varying degrees of political and legal significance, but they are always administrative divisions of the state. Counties in many states are further subdivided into townships, which, by definition, are administrative divisions of a county. In some states, such as Michigan, a township can file a charter with the state government, making itself into a "charter township", which is a type of mixed municipal and township status (giving the township some of the rights of a city without all of the responsibilities), much in the way a metropolitan municipality is a mixed municipality and county.

GENEPIO:0000061	GENEPIO:0001420				Accuprobe Listeria monocytogenes Culture Identification Reagent Kit	Nucleic acid hybridization tests are based on the ability of complementary nucleic acid strands to specifically align and associate to form stable double-stranded complexes (6). The ACCUPROBE method uses a single-stranded DNA probe with a chemiluminescent label that is complementary to the ribosomal RNA of the target organism. After the ribosomal RNA is released from the target organism, the labeled DNA probe combines with the target organism’s ribosomal RNA to form a stable DNA:RNA hybrid. The Selection Reagent allows for the differentiation of non-hybridized and hybridized probes.The light signal emitted by the DNA:RNA hybrids is measured by a GEN-PROBE luminometer. A positive result is a luminometer reading equal to or greater than the cut-off. A value below this cut-off is the negative result.

GENEPIO:0000051	GENEPIO:0001420				core genome fingerprinting											
GENEPIO:0000064	GENEPIO:0001420				riboprinting	This method is based on restriction endonuclease digestion of bacterial chromosomal DNA, followed by Southern hybridization to probes for sequences in the regions of bacterial DNA coding for the 5S-16S-23S (the Escherichia coli rrnB rRNA operon) rRNA operon. The probes have been developed that are directed to highly conserved regions of the rRNA operon present in all eubacteria and can therefore be used for ribotyping most bacteria										
GENEPIO:0000063	GENEPIO:0001420				ribotyping	Ribotyping involves the fingerprinting of genomic DNA restriction fragments that contain all or part of the genes coding for the 16S and 23S rRNA. By digesting the genes with a specific restriction enzyme, fragments of different lengths are generated. By performing a Gel electrophoresis with the digested samples, the fragments can be visualised as lines on the gel, where larger fragments are close to the start of the gel, and smaller fragments further down. After blotting onto a matrix and probing, these lines form a unique pattern for each species and can be used to identify the origin of the DNA, almost like a barcode can identify a product.

OBI:0001941	GENEPIO:0001632			OBI:0001940	contig N50	N50 statistic computed for the contigs produced by the assembly process. A contig N50 is calculated by first ordering every contig by length from longest to shortest. Next, starting from the longest contig, the lengths of each contig are summed, until this running sum equals one-half of the total length of all contigs in the assembly. The contig N50 of the assembly is the length of the shortest contig in this list.

A lower length is indicative of assembly problems (insufficient read depth) or a mismatched reference genome.										
GENEPIO:0001570	GENEPIO:0001632				contig N99	The N99 length definition is identical to the N50 definition except that the threshold for determining the contigs is 1% of the nucleotides.  This contig basepair length can be compared to a minimum threshold to determine if gene annotation (where contigs greater than say 2000bp are necessary) would generally succeed.										
GENEPIO:0001566	GENEPIO:0001632				contig N99 length QC threshold	The contig N99 length QC threshold is the minimum length that a contig N99 or NG99 length datum can be for satisfactory QC.  This threshold avoids having too many gene coding regions prematurely clipped inside short contigs.  An assembly having 1% or more of its content in less than 2Kbp chunks is cause for concern. Bacterial genes are generally about 1Kbp in length.										
GENEPIO:0001631	GENEPIO:0001632				contig NG50	The NG50 length is the same as the N50 length except that the length of the reference genome is used in the calculation rather than the assembly genome size.

ERO:0001183	OBI:0000626				next generation DNA sequencing	A DNA sequencing technique that became commercially available in 2004 and is used by specific commercial platforms that embody a complex interplay of enzymology, chemistry, high-resolution optics, hardware, and software engineering. These instruments allow highly streamlined sample preparation steps prior to DNA sequencing, which provides a significant time savings and a minimal requirement for associated equipment in comparison to the highly automated, multistep pipelines necessary for clone-based high-throughput sequencing. Each technology amplifies single strands of a fragment library and perform sequencing reactions on the amplified strands. The fragment libraries are obtained by annealing platform-specific linkers to blunt-ended fragments generated directly from a genome or DNA source of interest. Because the presence of adapter sequences means that the molecules then can be selectively amplified by PCR, and no bacterial cloning step is required to amplify the genomic fragment in a bacterial intermediate as is done in traditional sequencing approaches.

GENEPIO:0001844	SIO:000507				origin	"In mathematics, the origin of a Euclidean space is a special point, usually denoted by the letter O, used as a fixed point of reference for the geometry of the surrounding space.  In physical problems, the choice of origin is often arbitrary, meaning any choice of origin will ultimately give the same answer. This allows one to pick an origin point that makes the mathematics as simple as possible, often by taking advantage of some kind of geometric symmetry."
